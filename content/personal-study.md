Regular study and application is needed for knowledge to grow.  In fact, without it, our bible knowledge deteriorates.  One attribute of a true Christian is his/her hunger and thirst for knowledge.  Whether a babe in Christ or a Christian ready for “strong meat”, tools are available online to assist in your study.
