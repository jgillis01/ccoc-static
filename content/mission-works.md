## Mission Works ##

The Central church of Christ in Martinsburg, WV, takes seriously Christ’s Great Commission to take the Gospel to all parts of the world.  In addition to occasional one-time requests for support we provide regular support to a number of works in the United States and abroad.  An email link is provided so that you may send a word of encouragement to these missionaries.

To prepare men to preach the word, and equip young families with the knowledge and values necessary to be strong pillars and solid workers in the Lord’s church, we support two Schools of Preaching.  A website link is provided for you to visit the school websites and see the good works these schools produce.
